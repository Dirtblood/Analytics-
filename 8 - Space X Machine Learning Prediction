Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
Assignment: Machine Learning Prediction
Estimated time needed: 60 minutes

Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.



Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:



Most unsuccessful landings are planed. Space X; performs a controlled landing in the oceans.

We split the data into training and testing data using the function train_test_split. The training data is divided into validation data, a second set used for training data; then the models are trained and hyperparameters are selected using the function GridSearchCV.

TASK 3
Use the function train_test_split to split the data X and Y into training and test data. Set the parameter test_size to 0.2 and random_state to 2. The training data and test data should be assigned to the following labels.

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, random_state=2, test_size= 0.2)
we can see we only have 18 test samples.

TASK 4
Create a logistic regression object then create a GridSearchCV object logreg_cv with cv = 10. Fit the object to find the best parameters from the dictionary parameters.

parameters ={'C':[0.01,0.1,1],
             'penalty':['l2'],
             'solver':['lbfgs']}
parameters ={"C":[0.01,0.1,1],'penalty':['l2'], 'solver':['lbfgs']}# l1 lasso l2 ridge
lr=LogisticRegression()
logreg_cv = GridSearchCV(lr, parameters, cv = 10).fit(X_train, Y_train)
logreg_cv
GridSearchCV(cv=10, estimator=LogisticRegression(),
             param_grid={'C': [0.01, 0.1, 1], 'penalty': ['l2'],
                         'solver': ['lbfgs']})
In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.
On GitHub, the HTML representation is unable to render, please try loading this page with nbviewer.org.
We output the GridSearchCV object for logistic regression. We display the best parameters using the data attribute best_params_ and the accuracy on the validation data using the data attribute best_score_.

print("tuned hpyerparameters :(best parameters) ",logreg_cv.best_params_)
print("accuracy :",logreg_cv.best_score_)
tuned hpyerparameters :(best parameters)  {'C': 0.01, 'penalty': 'l2', 'solver': 'lbfgs'}
accuracy : 0.8464285714285713
TASK 5
Calculate the accuracy on the test data using the method score:

print(f"Logistic Regression Score: {logreg_cv.score(X_test, Y_test)}")
Logistic Regression Score: 0.8333333333333334
Lets look at the confusion matrix:

yhat=logreg_cv.predict(X_test)
plot_confusion_matrix(Y_test,yhat)

Examining the confusion matrix, we see that logistic regression can distinguish between the different classes. We see that the major problem is false positives.

              'gamma':np.logspace(-3, 3, 5)}
svm = SVC()
svm_cv = GridSearchCV(svm, parameters, cv = 10).fit(X_train, Y_train)
svm_cv
GridSearchCV(cv=10, estimator=SVC(),
             param_grid={'C': array([1.00000000e-03, 3.16227766e-02, 1.00000000e+00, 3.16227766e+01,

Calculate the accuracy on the test data using the method score:

print(f"SVM Accuracy: {svm_cv.score(X_test, Y_test)}")
SVM Accuracy: 0.8333333333333334
We can plot the confusion matrix
